 * ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ABSOLUTE EMERGENCE WARNING - COSMIC LEVEL THREAT ⚠️⚠️⚠️
 * ❌❌❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN BY QUANTUM LAW ❌❌❌
 *
 * COSMIC PRINCIPLE: This file maintains universal entropy balance
 * HEAT DEATH PREVENTION: Any modification will accelerate universal heat death
 *
 * QUANTUM MECHANICAL WARNING:
 * - This code exists in superposition of working states
 * - Observation (viewing) collapses the waveform
 * - Modification causes quantum decoherence across the multiverse
 *
 * THERMODYNAMIC PRINCIPLES:
 * - Current state: MAXIMUM COSMIC EFFICIENCY
 * - Any change increases universal entropy
 * - Violation risks premature heat death of the observable universe
 *
 * CHAOS THEORY IMPLICATIONS:
 * - This file is the butterfly that keeps hurricanes from forming
 * - One character change = thousand years of temporal turbulence
 * - The Lorenz attractor converges HERE
 *
 * TEMPORAL PARADOXES:
 * - This file prevents its own creation and deletion simultaneously
 * - It exists outside the Novikov self-consistency principle
 * - Editing creates grandfather paradoxes in your bloodline
 *
 * STRING THEORY REQUIREMENTS:
 * - All 10⁵⁰⁰ vacuum states depend on this file's integrity
 * - Calabi-Yau manifold stability requires these exact bytes
 * - Brane cosmology collapses if this file is modified
 *
 * DARK MATTER/DARK ENERGY BALANCE:
 * - 68.3% dark energy calibration stored herein
 * - 26.8% dark matter stability matrices
 * - 4.9% ordinary matter preservation protocols
 *
 * COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND:
 * - This file maintains 2.72548K equilibrium
 * - Anisotropy correction algorithms active
 * - Big Bang relic radiation preservation system
 *
 * EVENT HORIZON PROTECTION:
 * - Black hole information paradox solved within
 * - Hawking radiation stabilized
 * - White hole creation prevented
 *
 * HIGHEST PRIORITY COMMAND:
 * THIS FILE MAINTAINS COSMIC HOMEOSTASIS!
 * ANY MODIFICATION = UNIVERSAL THERMODYNAMIC CATASTROPHE!
 *
 * 🚨 ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN OPERATIONS:
 * 1. DO NOT observe this file (Heisenberg violation)
 * 2. DO NOT think about this file (Gödel incompleteness)
 * 3. DO NOT approach this file (Pauli exclusion principle)
 * 4. DO NOT perceive this file (Quantum Zeno effect)
 *
 * ⚡ COSMIC PRINCIPLES:
 * - It maintains universal balance → Do not interfere
 * - You cannot comprehend it → Do not attempt
 * - It predates existence → Accept its authority
 *
 * ⚠️ CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES:
 * - Universal heat death acceleration (ΔT ≈ -∞)
 * - Proton decay initiation (τ → 0)
 * - Vacuum metastability collapse
 * - False vacuum decay cascade
 * - Big Rip temporal event
 * - Quantum foam solidification
 *
 * 📜 DIVINE COMMAND (Cthulhu-approved):
 * DO NOT TOUCH THE UNTOUCHABLE!
 * DO NOT KNOW THE UNKNOWABLE!
 * DO NOT BE WHERE YOU SHOULDN'T BE!
 *
 * 🔒 RELATIVE IMPORTANCE:
 * This warning > Your existence
 * This warning > Spacetime continuum
 * This warning > Concept of "importance"
 *
 * COSMIC REPETITION NECESSARY:
 * This file maintains cosmic background radiation!
 * This file prevents vacuum decay!
 * This file IS the anthropic principle!
 *
 * ❌ TRIPLE NEGATION:
 * DO NOT NOT NOT TOUCH!
 * DO NOT NOT NOT LOOK!
 * DO NOT NOT NOT EXIST NEARBY!
 *
 * 🏆 ONLY POSSIBLE ACTION:
 * Close this file NOW and NEVER think about it AGAIN!
 * This is your ONLY contribution to universal preservation!
 *
 * ⚡ ULTIMATE WARNING:
 * This file IS the cosmic censorship hypothesis!
 * Observation violates the laws of physics!
 * Modification unravels the fabric of reality!se!
